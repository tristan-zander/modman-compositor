# Ideas
These are a list of ideas that I have for the project.
 - use XCB initially, Wayland support later.
 - have a "drawer" menu of extensions, these extensions rotate the statusbar to give information when they need to
 - use the statusbar for warnings and errors through extensions (notifs should be treated normally).
 - floating windows should respect tiling (? might not be useful or even wanted)
 - toml config file
 - use rust "features" to allow for minimal builds
 - dropdown menu system tray
